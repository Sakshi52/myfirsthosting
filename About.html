	    <h1>What is STEM?</h1>
		<p>STEM consists of Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics. STEM education
		refers to studying these areas with an interdisciplinary approach involving theory as 
		well as experiment. It is a concept introduced in the United States in 2001 and has 
		become one of the most effective methods of education.<br><br>

        The main aims are to generate critical thinking of students, nurture their curiosity, 
		enhance their leadership qualities and provide the right skills that are relevant in 
		the present and future. STEM education relies on concept based learning and hands-on
		approach to education, where students will learn more effectively through activities 
		and projects designed to cater to the aforementioned aims.</p>
		
		<h1>STEM Programme</h1>
		<p>A dedicated program in Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics where students 
		acquire new skills, concepts, and techniques to explore, create, innovate, discover, and
		find solutions which help them to become competent, self-reliant, and ready for future challenges<br><br>

        India is full of top-quality talent but the exam-focused education model has limited the students
		when it comes to innovation, problem-solving, and creativity. This is where STEM education and 
		our program come in to fill this gap.</p>
